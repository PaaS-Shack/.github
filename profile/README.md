# Paas-Shack Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the **PaaS-Shack** project, a microservices-based architecture designed to provide flexible and scalable solutions for various infrastructure and networking needs. This project embraces the principles of microservices, allowing each component to operate independently while contributing to the overall functionality of the system.

## Project Scope

The PaaS-Shack project aims to address the challenges of modern infrastructure and networking management. It offers a suite of microservices, each specializing in a specific domain, such as DNS management, proxy services, and more. With a focus on modularity and extensibility, PaaS-Shack provides a powerful and customizable platform for infrastructure management.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes a diverse technology stack to achieve its goals, including:

- JavaScript for server-side logic
- EJS for user interface templating
- Docker for containerization
- MongoDB for data storage
- Gitea for source code management
- And various other tools and libraries to support different components.

## Architecture Overview

PaaS-Shack follows a microservices architecture, where each service operates as an independent unit with its own responsibilities. This approach allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and the ability to replace or upgrade individual services without affecting the entire system.

## Components and Services

Key components and services within the PaaS-Shack project include:

- **NOC (Network Operations Center):** Centralized management for network-related operations.
- **UI (User Interface):** The web-based user interface for interacting with PaaS-Shack services.
- **Proxy:** A proxy server that routes client requests to backend services.
- **Gitea:** A service that provides RESTful access to code repositories.
- **Repos:** A code repository service for managing source code.
- **DNS:** A molecularjs DNS nameserver for managing DNS records.
- **Syslog:** A logging service for system logs.
- **Cron-mixin:** A mixin for scheduling cron jobs.
- **Config-mixin:** A mixin for managing configuration settings.

These components work together to offer a robust infrastructure management platform.
